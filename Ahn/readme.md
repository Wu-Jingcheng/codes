# Readme

The codes include results from https://github.com/ByeongjooAhn/conv_nlos apart from "soap", "numbers" and "toys". If they are needed, please look into the original links.

To initialize the codes, you might have to run *~\lib\lib_convnlos\compile_mex.m*.

To implement 1D FBP method and denoising, run *laplacian.m*. The result is up to $$N$$.

To implement denoising on 3D FBP method and no-priors Gram results, run *otsu.m*. The results are up to $$N$$s.

# Acknowledgments

This code set is based on the codes from Ahn et al. as well.
